# SettlX

SETTIX is a Web3 payment platform built to make online transactions faster,secure, transparent, and more reliable. It uses smart contracts to automate settlements between users so payments can happen instantly without needing centralized systems or third-party control.

The main goal of SETTIX is to connect blockchain payments with local bank systems, allowing users to send and receive funds in both crypto and fiat currencies. This creates a practical link between decentralized finance and traditional banking, helping merchants and users interact more freely across both systems.
SETTIX was developed to solve common problems like payment delays, high transaction fees, and trust issues between buyers and sellers. With blockchain, every transaction is transparent, secure, and tamper-proof, giving users confidence in every exchange.
